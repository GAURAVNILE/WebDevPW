Question 1
Answer :-
1.	Purpose:
•	Flexbox: Primarily designed for laying out items within a single dimension (either as a row or a column). It's ideal for creating flexible and space-efficient arrangements for items within a container.
•	Grid: Designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing for the precise positioning and alignment of items both horizontally and vertically within a container.
2.	Direction:
•	Flexbox: Works in a single direction, either horizontally (row) or vertically (column). It's perfect for creating layouts where items should expand and contract within that single direction.
•	Grid: Works in both horizontal and vertical directions, providing a grid-based structure. You can control both rows and columns simultaneously, making it suitable for more complex and structured layouts.
3.	Alignment:
•	Flexbox: Great for aligning items within a container along the main axis (the direction of the flex container) and the cross axis (the perpendicular direction).
•	Grid: Provides extensive control over the alignment of items both vertically and horizontally, making it excellent for precise positioning and alignment.
4.	Nested Layouts:
•	Flexbox: Nested flex containers can be used within other flex containers. It's excellent for creating complex arrangements within a single dimension.
•	Grid: Allows for nesting as well, making it suitable for creating multidimensional layouts within other grid containers.
5.	Content Flow:
•	Flexbox: Content will stretch or shrink to fill available space in the main axis while maintaining its size along the cross axis.
•	Grid: Content can be placed precisely in predefined cells or tracks within the grid.
When to Choose Flexbox:
•	Use Flexbox when dealing with one-dimensional layouts, such as navigation bars, lists, or flexible content within a single container.
•	It's great for centering content both horizontally and vertically within a container.
•	When you want items to automatically adjust their size to fill available space in one direction while maintaining their size in the other direction.
When to Choose Grid:
•	Choose Grid when working with more complex two-dimensional layouts, such as grids, card-based layouts, or magazine-style designs.
•	Use it when you need precise control over the placement and alignment of items both horizontally and vertically.
•	For creating responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and orientations, as Grid can handle complex responsiveness more effectively.
In many cases, both Flexbox and Grid can be used in combination to achieve the desired layout, depending on the specific needs of your project. It's essential to understand the strengths and use cases of each layout model to make the best choice for your web design.
