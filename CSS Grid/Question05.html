<!-- Explanation:
The main difference between justify-items and justify-self is that justify-items applies to grid containers, while justify-self applies to grid items.
Let's understand them with an example. Consider the following code, which has 6 grid items arranged in a 3x2 grid: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Justify Items and Justify Self</title>
    <style>
        .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
            border: 1px solid black;
        }

        .container>div {
            padding: 5px;
            background-color: bisque;
            border: 1px solid black;
        }

        .box1 {
            justify-self: center;
        }

        .box2 {
            justify-self: end;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box1">Box 1</div>
        <div class="box2">Box 2</div>
        <div class="box3">Box 3</div>
        <div class="box4">Box 4</div>
        <div class="box5">Box 5</div>
        <div class="box6">Box 6</div>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
<!-- In this example, justify-items: center is applied to the grid container, which aligns the grid items in the center along the inline axis within their respective grid cells.
The justify-self property is used to control the alignment of specific grid items within their grid cells along the horizontal axis. In this example, justify-self: center is applied to .box1, which centers it within its grid cell. justify-self: end is applied to .box2, which aligns it to the end of its grid cell. -->
